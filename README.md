### Scenario: Starting program state

GIVEN that the submit button has not been pressed yet
AND the code has just loaded
THEN “NO calculation performed” should be displayed at the bottom
Scenario: Dividing numbers result in a whole number

GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
WHEN 20 is entered into the first input
AND 10 is entered into the second input
THEN 2 should be displayed at the bottom
 
## Unresolved Stories
### [X] Scenario: Dividing numbers result in a decimal number

WHEN either or both inputs are empty
THEN the divisions should not be done
AND the following should be displayed: “Division not performed. Both values are required in inputs. Try again”.
 

### [ ] Scenario: An invalid division should log an error in the console

GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
WHEN 20 is entered into the first input
AND -3 is entered into the second input
THEN the division should not be done
AND the following should be displayed: “Division not performed. Invalid number provided. Try again”.
AND an error should be logged in the browser console that shows the call stack
BUT the program should not crash entirely
 

### Scenario: Providing anything that is not a number should crash the program

GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
